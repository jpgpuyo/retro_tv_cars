# retro_tv_cars

A new Flutter web created for [Flutter hackaton 2020](https://flutterhackathon.com)

## What can I have found in this project?

I have recreated the Knight Rider and Delorian control panels.
Just for fun!
I don't expect that this project works also for mobile or iOS, probably in the future I will try to make UI responsive to all platforms.

You can see the results here:
